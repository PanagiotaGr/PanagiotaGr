## Selected Projects

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Navigation](https://github.com/PanagiotaGr/DynNav-Dynamic-Navigation-Rerouting-in-Unknown-Environments)**  
 Research codebase for autonomous navigation and online replanning in unknown environments.
  Emphasis on explicit modeling of uncertainty and risk, learning-augmented planning, and reproducible experimental evaluation (ROS 2).

- **[Risk-Aware Return-to-Home Policy for UAVs](https://github.com/PanagiotaGr/Risk-Aware-Return-to-Home-Policy-for-UAVs-under-Battery-Uncertainty-and-Wind-Disturbances)**  
  Decision policy for safe mission abort and return under battery uncertainty and wind disturbances.  
  Focus on robustness, safety thresholds, and uncertainty-aware decision-making (ROS 2).

- **[Aircraft Approach and Landing Simulation](https://github.com/PanagiotaGr/Aircraft-Approach-Landing-)**  
  Simplified 3-DOF point-mass aircraft model with ILS-like guidance laws.  
  Designed for educational use and research prototyping with interpretable dynamics.
