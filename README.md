## Projects

- **Dynamic Navigation & Rerouting in Unknown Environments**  
  Uncertainty-aware and risk-sensitive autonomous navigation and replanning in unknown environments, implemented in ROS 2 with reproducible experiments.

- **Risk-Aware Return-to-Home Policy for UAVs**  
  Policy design for safe UAV return under battery uncertainty and wind disturbances, with a focus on robustness and decision-making under uncertainty.

- **Aircraft Approach and Landing Simulation**  
  Simplified aircraft approach and landing simulation based on 3-DOF point-mass dynamics and ILS-like guidance laws, intended for educational and research prototyping.
